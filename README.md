# Socket Data Handler

`Socket Data Handler` is basically a `communication protocol`, that is written in `Java` language. As the basic meaning
of
the `protocol`, this will help users to communicate between other socket connections with a specific method. This is not
bound to the `text` based communication. In core, it's all about `bytes`. But don't worry, you don't need to work
directly with bytes! Also, **if you need to use another programming language as the client or server, yes you can!** You
just need to follow the order of this `protocol` and implement it in other languages. Also note that **this library is
just an `IO` tool and you still need to work on your network security and data encryption parts.**

## Why?

Socket Data Handler is a fully managed communication library. It means this library helps you to lower the pain of
using the default socket input and output mechanism. This library is working on top of that default system but
managed in every possible way (that I can find and develop with my knowledge and experience XD). If you wish to see
how, please take a look at the [developer docs](Docs/Dev/README.md).

## Import? It's easy!

![Central Repository](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.naveenb2004/SocketDataHandler
)\
If you are using project managers like `Maven`, `Gradle` etc., please take a look at
the [Central repository page for this project](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.naveenb2004/SocketDataHandler).
You can find most of the import snippets for project managers from there. For `Maven`:

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.naveenb2004</groupId>
    <artifactId>SocketDataHandler</artifactId>
    <version><!-- set version --></version>
</dependency>
```

## Usage

- Please refer to the [user guids](Docs/User/README.md) to know how this library is going to make your work easy üòé. If
  you feel too lazy to read docs (not recommended), here are [some example codes](src/test/java) for you!
- Please refer to the [developer guids](Docs/Dev/README.md) to know how developers are going to smile (or maybe laugh at
  me) üòÅ.
