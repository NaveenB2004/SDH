# Socket Data Handler

`Socket Data Handler` is basically a `communication protocol`, that written in `Java` language. As the basic meaning of
the `protocol`, this will help users to communicate between other socket connections with a specific method. This is not
bound to the `text` based communication. In core, it's all about `bytes`. But don't worry, you don't need to work
directly with bytes! Also, **if you need to use another programming language as the client or server, yes you can!** You
just need to follow the order of this `protocol` and implement in other language. Also note that, **this library is just
a `IO` tool and you still need to work on your network and data encryption parts.**

## Why?

Socket Data Handler is a fully managed communication library. It means, this library is helps you to low the pain of
using the default socket input and output mechanism. This library is working on the top of that default system, but
managed in every possible ways (that I can find and develop with my knowledge and experience XD). If you love to see
how, please take a look at the [developer docs](Docs/Dev/README.md).
